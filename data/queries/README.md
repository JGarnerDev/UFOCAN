## SQL Queries for UNFOCAN

WIP. Starting to setup SQL for returning UFO info

Views:
* Views are configured in `data/queries/views/views.sql`
* Views are created or updated by running `data/queries/config_views.py`

SQL:
all queries are located in UFOCAN/data/queries/sql/
* These sql queries have spots where user defined params can be formatted into the string before querying the database.
